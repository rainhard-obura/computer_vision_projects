## ðŸš€ Projects Overview

### 1. Amini Canopy Crop Challenge
- **Goal**: Segment canopy vs. non-canopy regions in aerial images.
- **Approach**: Image preprocessing â†’ segmentation model (U-Net or similar) â†’ mask visualization & coverage analysis.
- Check the notebook in its folder for detailed methodology and results.

### 2. Amini Cocoa Contamination Challenge
- **Goal**: Detect and classify contamination in cocoa bean images.
- **Approach**: Feature engineering, binary/multi-class classification, performance metrics, and visual validation of model output.

### 3. Root Volume Estimation Challenge
- **Goal**: Estimate the volume of tree roots or soil volume underneath from image data.
- **Approach**: Image-to-depth regression or segmentation; conversion from pixel measurements to volume estimates followed by accuracy assessment.
